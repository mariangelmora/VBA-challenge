For this assignment I followed the same logic as on the CreditCardChecker exercise for students on gitlab, I also reference to the exercise UScensus part1 and part 2. To loop through the different worksheets I went throught the documentation available on the US census part 1 student exercise where it explains how to loop into different worksheets at once and I used the same fundamentals found here "https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/macro-to-loop-through-all-worksheets-in-a-workbook-feef14e3-97cf-00e2-538b-5da40186e2b0". I also attended a tutoring session in which the tutor helped me to clean out my code seems it did not look very clean. I did ask XpertLearningAssistant for some guidance to find the yearly change and calculate the percentage change as accomodated it on my project both codes are located on the 1st and 2nd repo and were changed as need it for my current code.
